# 🏭 Smart Sand Reusability Predictor

AI Powered Foundry Intelligence System for Sustainable Sand Management.

## 📌 Problem
Foundries reuse sand multiple times, but there is no intelligent system to predict reuse limit. Overused sand causes casting defects and financial loss.

## 🚀 Solution
This project uses Machine Learning (Random Forest) to:
- Predict remaining reuse cycles
- Calculate sand health score
- Estimate defect risk
- Provide intelligent recommendation
- Allow dataset upload
- Export reports

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Plotly

## ▶ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

## 🌍 Future Scope
- IoT sensor integration
- Cloud deployment
- Industrial automation integration
